# G-code interpreter
Interpreter for G-code

This interpreter is designed for specific G-code program, found in program files rectangle.gcode.

This is not fully compliant interpreter for G-code, but a partial design that can be developed further.

Important features are missing such as:

* G-code modality
* Implementation of all NC-words

Also, the called MachineClient is only a stub API that is meant to be just a execution simulator.

MachineClient is not programmed by me!
